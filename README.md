# Lifetracker Backend

This is a backend service to serve up data from [Felix Krause's
LifeSheet](https://github.com/KrauseFx/FxLifeSheet). This pairs with [my Angular
frontend](https://github.com/b-turchyn/lifetracker-frontend).

The goal is to find a way to represent the data that I personally understand
better.
